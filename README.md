# Assignment
Create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

# User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

# Business Content
- An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

# Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.  
The user should be able to:
- Sort the table by at least one category  
- Filter the users by at least one property.  

# Functionnality
## Search Button
- The Data set from the API call will be searche by the location state
## First Name Sort Button
- The Data set from the API call will be sorted by the first name of the employee
## Last Name Sort Button
- The Data set from the API call will be sorted by the last name of the employee
